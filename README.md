# Student_CRUD
this project involves managing student data in a database, and you've implemented several operations for this purpose:

1. Creating a Student: You can create a new student record by providing student details and inserting it into the database.

2. Creating Multiple Students: This operation allows you to insert multiple student records into the database simultaneously.

3. Reading Student Information: You can retrieve and display the information of a specific student by providing the student's ID.

4. Querying for Students: You can query the database for students based on specific criteria, which could include attributes like name, ID, or other parameters.

5. Querying Students by Last Name: This operation specifically retrieves students based on their last names.

6. Updating Student Information: You can update an existing student's details by providing the modified information.

7. Deleting a Student: You can delete a specific student record from the database.

8. Deleting All Students: This operation allows you to clear all student records from the database.

These operations collectively make up a student management system, commonly used in educational institutions to handle student data and information efficiently.
